## Customization

Edit `seed-mock-data.ts` to customize:

```typescript
// Change quantities
for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) { // More/fewer items

// Modify data
const companies = ['YourCompany', ...]; // Your company names

// Adjust dates
randomDate(new Date(2024, 0, 1), new Date()) // Date range
```

## Clean Up Mock Data

### Option 1: Firebase Console
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Navigate to Firestore Database
3. Delete collections manually

### Option 2: Cleanup Script (TODO)
```bash
npm run cleanup  # Coming soon
```

### Option 3: Fresh Start
1. Create new Firebase project
2. Update .env with new credentials
3. Run seed script

## Best Practices

### For Demos
- ✅ Seed 1-2 days before
- ✅ Verify all pages load
- ✅ Test key workflows
- ✅ Check mobile responsiveness

### For Development
- ✅ Use Firebase emulator
- ✅ Seed locally
- ✅ Don't commit mock data

### For Production
- ❌ Never seed production database
- ✅ Use staging environment
- ✅ Test with real users

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" error
```bash
cd scripts
npm install
```

### "Firebase config not found"
```bash
# Copy from main project
cp ../.env.local .env
```

### "Permission denied"
- Check Firebase rules
- Verify API key is correct
- Ensure project ID matches

### Duplicate data
- Script creates new data each run
- Use unique timestamps in IDs
- Clean up before re-seeding
