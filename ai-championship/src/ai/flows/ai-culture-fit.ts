Do not focus on skills or technical qualifications. Instead, focus on the soft signals in the language used.

- Analyze the job description for words that suggest a specific culture (e.g., "fast-paced," "highly collaborative," "autonomous," "mission-driven," "work-life balance").
- Analyze the resume for experiences and descriptions that align or clash with that culture (e.g., experience at large, slow-moving corporations vs. scrappy startups; mentions of team projects vs. solo achievements).

Based on this analysis, provide a concise, one-paragraph summary of the candidate's potential cultural fit.

Job Description:

{{{jobDescription}}}

Candidate's Resume:

{{{candidateResume}}}
